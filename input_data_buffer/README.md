# median_mean_fifo

Median filter and mean filter fifo module with FIFO interfaces and extra input data buffer.

I choose "peppers_color.bmp", 
         "peppers_color_noise.bmp", 
         "woman_blonde.bmp" ,
         "woman_blonde_noise.bmp" four images to implement median and mean fifo.

And data_buffer[3][6] in filter.cpp is the input data buffer for storing pixels which sent from the Testbench.cpp .
